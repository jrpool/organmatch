        <p class="summary">Your patients&rsquo; lives depend on you&mdash;and on luck</p>
      </header>
      <p>OrganMatch is a turn-based game for 3 to 8 players.</p>
      <p>You and your fellow surgeons have patients needing organ transplants. There are not enough organs, so some patients will not survive the wait.</p>
      <p>The outcome is partly out of your control:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Organs and patients belong to categories. An organ matches a patient only if the patient needs that organ <strong>and</strong> they belong to the same category.</li>
        <li>Patients differ in priority.</li>
        <li>Patients differ in how long they have been waiting.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But it partly depends on your skill:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You will discover some facts about patients that you can use to increase or decrease their priorities.</li>
        <li>You will have opportunities to change the patients you are caring for.</li>
      </ul>
