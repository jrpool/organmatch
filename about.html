        <p class="summary">Your patient&rsquo;s life depends on you&mdash;and luck</p>
      </header>
      <p>OrganMatch is a turn-based game for 3 to 8 players.</p>
      <p>You and your fellow surgeons have patients needing organ transplants. There are not enough organs, so some patients will not survive the wait.</p>
      <p>Organs and patients belong to categories. An organ matches a patient only if the patient needs that organ <strong>and</strong> they belong to the same category.</p>
      <p>Patients differ in priority.</p>
      <p>Patients differ in how long they have been waiting.</p>
      <p>You will discover some facts about patients that you can use to increase or decrease their priorities.</p>
      <p>You will have opportunities to change the patients you are caring for.</p>
      <p>Whether your patients live or die will depend on them, on your skill in collegial decisionmaking, and on the luck of the draw.</p>
