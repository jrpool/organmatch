        <p class="summary">Your patient&rsquo;s life depends on you&mdash;and on luck</p>
      </header>
      <p>You and your fellow surgeons have patients needing organ transplants. There are not enough organs to satisfy the need, so some patients will not survive the wait.</p>
      <p>Organs and patients belong to various categories, based on genetics and body size. Not all organs are good matches for all patients.</p>
      <p>Patients vary in their:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>needs for a transplant</li>
        <li>abilities to cooperate</li>
        <li>post-transplant life expectancies</li>
        <li>prospects for happy life</li>
        <li>importances as parents and caregivers</li>
        <li>expected contributions to social welfare</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The inflow of new organs depends on unpredictable events, such as accidental deaths and consents to organ donation.</p>
      <p>Whether your patients live or die will depend on them, on your skill in collegial decisionmaking, and on the luck of the draw.</p>
      <p>Warning: The inventor of OrganMatch provides no warranty against nightmares of guilt, if you play shortly before going to sleep!</p>
